+---------------------------------------+

Description:
The Legend of Drongo was a project I started as a means to familiarise myself with C# programming concepts for my studies. Following my studies the project was mothballed and is worked on in sprints as and when I have the time. It is a hobby and is the accumulated skilled I have gained over the past 3 years of dev experience, so naturally some areas of the program are poorly designed and executed. However I am constantly making changes to the engine, and one day hope to release as an indie game.
